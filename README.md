# 🚀 ML Engineering Projects

This repository contains **end-to-end Machine Learning Engineering projects** built using clean, modular, and production-oriented workflows.  
The focus is on writing **maintainable code**, following **real-world ML engineering practices**, and separating experimentation from reusable logic.

Each project reflects how ML systems are developed in industry — from **data loading** and **preprocessing** to **model training**, **evaluation**, and **experimentation**.

## 📌 What This Repository Demonstrates

- ✅ **Clean and modular Python code structure**  
- ✅ **Separation of concerns**: data, features, models, training  
- ✅ **Reproducible experiments** using Jupyter notebooks  
- ✅ **Script-based pipelines** for training and evaluation  
- ✅ **Industry-style ML project organization**  
- ✅ Emphasis on **readability, scalability, and reusability**

## 🛠 Typical Workflow

1. **Load and validate data** using dedicated loader functions  
2. **Exploratory data analysis** in notebooks  
3. **Preprocessing & feature engineering** pipelines  
4. **Train and tune models** using clean scripts  
5. **Evaluate models** using proper metrics  
6. Keep **core logic reusable** in Python modules

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**  
- **NumPy**, **Pandas**  
- **Scikit-learn** (and other ML libraries)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis  
- **VS Code** for development

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed to showcase **ML Engineering skills**, not just model accuracy.  
It reflects how machine learning code is **organized, maintained, and scaled** in professional environments.

> UI development and dashboards are intentionally kept out of scope so the focus remains on **modeling, training, tuning, and engineering best practices**.
