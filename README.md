🚀 ML Engineering Projects
This repository contains end-to-end Machine Learning engineering projects built using clean, modular, and production-oriented workflows.
Each project follows industry-standard practices including data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and reproducibility.

🎯 Purpose of This Repository
Apply real ML engineering workflows, not just notebooks
Build clean, reusable pipelines
Practice production-ready structure
Showcase projects in a recruiter-friendly format
This repo is intentionally different from experimentation or learning notebooks — it focuses on how ML systems are built in real projects.

🧱 Project Structure (Standardized)
Each project follows a structure similar to:
project-name/
│
├── data/                # Raw / processed datasets
├── notebooks/           # Analysis & EDA notebooks
├── src/                 # Core ML pipeline code
│   ├── data_loader.py
│   ├── preprocessing.py
│   ├── features.py
│   ├── train.py
│   └── evaluate.py
│
├── requirements.txt     # Dependencies
